# Epic 125: Web: file churn heatmap

**Wave 3 · Branch `epic/125-web-heatmap` · Issue: `gh issue list --search "Epic 125 in:title"` · Model: DeepSeek V4.1 Flash · Budget: 60–120 min of autonomous work**

## Where you are
Starling (`.orchestrator/PRD.md`) is an open-source, open-weight-first harness. It turns one coding goal into a lane-safe task DAG, runs a flock of opencode agents in parallel git worktrees on this laptop and on other laptops ("perches"), audits each result, and merges everything through a queue, shown live in a murmuration dashboard.

**Waves 0, 1, C1 and 2 are merged** (tags `epic-NN-complete`). About 2,500 tests pass across every package, the CLI, server, web dashboard, skill, tools and evals. Epic 40 (integration captain) is landing the **real** composition (`starling run` driving real opencode agents) in parallel with you, so for now `apps/cli`, `packages/core`, `packages/llm`, `packages/runner` and `apps/web/src/data` are **off limits** (Wave 3b takes them after Epic 40 merges).

**Wave 3 is the big one: about 100 agents run at the same time on one laptop**, each in its own worktree and lane. That only works if everyone follows the rules below exactly.

**Read before you start:** `AGENTS.md`, `.orchestrator/ARCHITECTURE.md` (§6 contracts, §7 locked decisions), the `docs/epic-*.md` for every package you touch (their "Interfaces for future epics" sections), the handbacks in `.orchestrator/handbacks/` that mention your area, and **`.orchestrator/fix-requests-w2.md`**.

## Tech decisions already locked (build on these, don't relitigate)
ARCHITECTURE §7 **L1–L31** still hold (Bun 1.4.4, TS 5.9.3, zod 4, Biome 2.6.3; web tests run in their own process; Markdown formatter off; no local models; real LLM calls only via the `opencode` profile). Wave 3 adds:
- **L32 Lanes are absolute.** Write only inside your lane, plus your own `docs/epic-125-web-heatmap.md` and `.orchestrator/handbacks/125-web-heatmap.md`. Shared registration files you don't own (`apps/web/src/App.tsx` and `app/Layout.tsx`, `apps/cli/src/program.ts`, `apps/server/src/app.ts`, any package `index.ts` outside your lane) are **wired later by checkpoint C3**. Ship your work as a self-contained module with the manifest described in your prompt, and say in the handback exactly what C3 must add (file, line, code).
- **L33 Public APIs are additive only.** Never rename or remove an export, field, route, CLI flag or event other code uses. Deprecate instead. About 100 branches merge after yours.
- **L34 No new dependencies.** Don't touch any `package.json` dependency list, `bun.lock`, the root `package.json`, `tsconfig.base.json` or `biome.json`. Everything you need is already installed (React 19, lucide-react, zustand, @xyflow/react, Tailwind v4, Hono, commander, zod, bun:test, happy-dom, Playwright). If something is truly missing, write a CONTRACT REQUEST instead.
- **L35 Heavy commands go through the slot gate.** With 100 agents, everyone running the full suite at once would melt the laptop. While iterating, run **only your own tests** (`bun test <your dir>`; for web code `cd apps/web && bun test src/features/<x>`) and **only your own typecheck** (`bunx tsc --noEmit -p <your package or app>`). Run the full suite **once, at the end**, through the gate: `bash .orchestrator/bin/heavy.sh bun run test` and `bash .orchestrator/bin/heavy.sh bun run check` (also wrap `bun run build` and any Playwright run). The gate may print "waiting" for a few minutes. If your shell tool times out while it waits, just run it again.
- **L36 Bugs outside your lane are FIX REQUESTS, never edits.** QA epics record a confirmed bug as **`test.todo('BUG <area>: <one line>', () => { ... })`** with the real assertions inside, plus a FIX REQUEST. Never use `test.failing` and never commit a red test: about 100 fixes land in parallel, and a `test.failing` turns red the moment someone fixes the bug. **The one allowed cross-lane edit:** if your fix makes an existing `test.failing` probe in `tools/security/**` pass, change that probe's `test.failing(` to `test(` in the same PR (nothing else in that file) and say so in the handback.
- **L37 No real model calls and no real Starling runs in Wave 3a** unless your prompt says otherwise. Use the recorded runs in `fixtures/runs/*.jsonl`, `@starling/core/testing` fakes and the mock compose paths. No Ollama, no local models (L23).
- **L38 Tests live next to the code, and everything is deterministic.** No sleeps over 50 ms, no wall-clock assertions, no network beyond `127.0.0.1` on port `0`, and temp dirs under `os.tmpdir()` that clean up after themselves. Another 99 agents are hammering the CPU, so timing-sensitive tests will flake.
- **L39 Web feature manifest (new feature folders).** Your folder's `index.ts` exports your components plus one manifest, so C3 can wire about 15 new features with one line each:
  ```ts
  import type { ComponentType } from 'react';
  import type { SkyState } from '../../data/reducer';
  export interface FeatureProps { state: SkyState; onSelectTask?(key: string): void; onSelectRun?(runId: string): void; onClose?(): void }
  export const feature = {
    id: '<folder-name>', title: 'Human title', description: 'One line for the command palette',
    kind: 'view' /* centre view like Sky/DAG */ | 'panel' /* side or bottom panel */ | 'overlay' /* modal, palette, toasts, tour */ | 'page' /* full page at ?page=<id> */,
    icon: '<lucide-react icon name>', hotkey: '<your assigned key or undefined>',
    Component: YourRootComponent as ComponentType<FeatureProps>,
  } as const;
  ```
  Read state only through `FeatureProps` and the existing pure selectors in `apps/web/src/data/selectors.ts` (import, never edit). Build a `Playground.tsx` + `playground.html` (copy the pattern from `features/dag`) so the feature can be seen on its own with `fixtures/runs/*.jsonl` data. Use only the existing design tokens and components (`apps/web/src/components`, `index.css` tokens). Light **and** dark mode, keyboard reachable, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
  Hotkeys already taken: `1 2 b f ? Esc` and the arrows. Wave 3 assignments: report `r`, timeline `t`, lanes `l`, costs `c`, console `` ` ``, settings `,`, palette `mod+k`, compare `x`, export `e`, scrubber `.`, heatmap `h`, leaderboard `L`, stage `s`, topology `o`, health `!`. Everything else gets no hotkey.
- **SkyState facts you must design around** (`apps/web/src/data/reducer.ts`, read-only):
  `state.events` holds only the **active run's** events plus global `runId: '*'` flock events, capped at `EVENT_CAP` = 5,000, so every derivation needs a fallback from the `Run`/`TaskRun` snapshots in `state.runs` (`startedAt`, `finishedAt`, `status`, `attempts`, `usage`, `costUsd`, `nodeId`, `lastVerdict`). `state.verdicts` and `state.agentLog` are keyed by **task key only** (not run), so filter them by the active run's task keys. `state.metricsHistory` is not per run. `activeRunOf`, `sortedRuns`, `sortedNodes`, `displayTasks` come from `data/selectors.ts`.
- **Event contract drift.** Epic 40 is adding `'run.status'` to core's `StarlingEvent` union and `nodeName?` to `TaskRun`. Never write an exhaustive `never` switch over `StarlingEvent['type']`: use a `default:` branch, and `isRunStatusEvent` from `../../data/run-status` for run status. Read `nodeName` structurally and fall back to `state.nodes[nodeId]?.name ?? nodeId`.
- **Imports.** Runtime values from `@starling/core/browser` only (`PRICING`, `usageCostUsd`, `globsOverlap`, `matchesGlob`, schemas); `import type` from it for types. Shared helpers: `lib/format` (`formatDuration`, `formatUsd`, `formatTokens`, `percent`; note `cached` is a **subset** of `input` in `TokenUsage`, so a token total is `input + output`, not `totalTokens()`, which adds `cached` too), `lib/status` (`STATUS_COLORS`, `statusLabel`, `taskTone`), `components` (`Panel`, `Stat`, `Badge`, `EmptyState`, `Tabs`, `Tooltip`, `Kbd`), `usePrefersReducedMotion`/`useNow` from `../metrics`. Another feature's helpers only through its `index.ts`.
- **The shell binds your hotkey** (Epic 112's registry, wired at C3). Don't add a document-level `keydown` listener for it; handle keys only while focus is inside your component. Extra props beyond `FeatureProps` must be **optional** (so the `ComponentType<FeatureProps>` cast stays honest); list them under **C3 wiring**. Also export `FEATURE = '<folder>' as const` (the existing folder smoke-test convention).
- **Playground recipe:** `applyEvents(createInitialState(), demoEvents().slice(0, i))` (from `../../data/reducer` and `../../data/demo`) with an event-index range slider, so the feature can be seen mid-run and at the end. Copy `features/dag/{playground.html,playground-main.tsx}`. Put the pure derivation in `derive.ts` (tested without a DOM), and component tests use `ensureDom()` from `../../lib/test-dom` + `@testing-library/react`. Clear `localStorage` after each test that writes it.

## FIRST TASK: carryover
Open `.orchestrator/fix-requests-w2.md`. Implement every request that targets a file in your lane, or decline it with a one-line reason. List each one in your handback under **Carryover done**.


## Your lane (you may write ONLY here)
`apps/web/src/features/heatmap/**`
plus `docs/epic-125-web-heatmap.md` and `.orchestrator/handbacks/125-web-heatmap.md`. Read anything.

## Goal
Where did the flock actually work, and where was it risky? The heatmap shows every file the agents touched, sized by churn (lines added + removed) and coloured by risk: conflicts, lane violations and fix attempts. It answers "what changed" (the lanes map, Epic 115, answers "who was allowed to change it").

## Deliverables
1. `heatmap/derive.ts`: `buildChurn(state: SkyState): ChurnFile[]`, `ChurnFile = { path, dir, added, removed, churn, tasks: string[], edits: number, fixAttempts: number, conflict: boolean, violation: boolean, risk: number }`. Sources: `state.agentLog[key]` events with `kind === 'file.edited'` (`data.path/added/removed`, validated), `state.diffs[diffKey(runId, key)]?.files` when present (wins over summed edits for that task), any structurally detected `task.diff` event in `state.events` (Epic 100 may add it), `merge.result.conflictedFiles` (`status: 'conflict'`), `verdict.laneViolations`, and `TaskRun.attempts` / failed verdict count per task spread over that task's files. Only the active run's task keys.
2. `riskScore(file)`: documented, monotonic formula (e.g. conflict +3, violation +2, +1 per fix attempt, +1 when ≥ 2 tasks touched it), clamped 0–5, with a legend explaining it.
3. `groupByDir(files, depth)` for the directory roll-up, and `layoutGrid(files, width)`: a pure packed-tile layout (tile area ∝ `sqrt(churn)` so small files stay visible; deterministic order by dir then churn).
4. `HeatmapView` (kind `view`): tiles grouped under directory headings, area = churn, fill = risk on a sequential scale built from tokens (calm teal → amber → red), text label + churn number on big tiles, an icon for conflict/violation (not colour alone). Hover: path, +added/−removed, tasks, attempts. Click → `onSelectTask(first task)`; `state.selectedTask` highlights its files. Toggle "Group by directory / Flat" and a sort selector (churn, risk, name).
5. Accessible table mode with the same data (sortable columns); tiles are focusable with roving tabindex inside the view.
6. Fixture truth: 8 files, `help/index.ts` the biggest (+112), `theme/index.ts` + `theme/index.test.ts` carry theme's fix attempt, 0 conflicts. Summary strip: "8 files · +599 −29 · 1 fix attempt · 0 conflicts".
7. `index.ts` manifest: id `heatmap`, kind `view`, icon `Flame`, hotkey `h`. Playground with the slider and a "spicy" toggle that injects a hand-made conflict + lane violation (in `heatmap/test-fixtures.ts`).
8. Tests: ≥ 16 derive/layout tests (fixture totals, diff overrides edits, malformed `file.edited` skipped, conflict/violation flags, risk formula table, foreign-run task keys ignored, layout determinism) and ≥ 8 component tests (tile count, click selects, selected highlight, table mode, sort, empty state "no files touched yet").

## Explicitly out of scope
- Lane ownership and the treemap of lanes (Epic 115). Fetching diffs (the shell fetches the selected task's diff; you only read `state.diffs`). Editing `data/`.

## Definition of done (run literally, paste results in the handback)
1. `bun install` clean in your worktree (it must not change `bun.lock`).
2. `cd apps/web && bun test src/features/heatmap` → 0 fail, ≥ 24 new tests
3. `bunx tsc --noEmit -p apps/web` clean, `bunx biome check apps/web/src/features/heatmap` clean
4. A happy-dom test of the fixture end state finds the summary "8 files · +599 −29"
5. `bash .orchestrator/bin/heavy.sh bun run test` at the repo root → 0 fail (paste both halves' summary lines).
6. `bash .orchestrator/bin/heavy.sh bun run check` → clean.
7. `docs/epic-125-web-heatmap.md` (AGENTS.md §6 sections) and `.orchestrator/handbacks/125-web-heatmap.md` written. The handback has **Carryover done**, **C3 wiring** (exact code C3 must add, or "none") and **FIX REQUESTS** (or "none") sections. PR opened per AGENTS.md §6 with `Closes #<issue>`. Print the PR URL last.

## Git
Branch `epic/125-web-heatmap`. Conventional Commits scoped to your lane, committed small and often (at least 5 commits). `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main` before pushing. No merging, no tags. Never `git add -A` at the repo root without checking `git status` first: only your lane's files belong in the PR.
