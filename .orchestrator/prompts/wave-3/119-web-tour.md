# Epic 119: Web: guided tour for judges

**Wave 3 · Branch `epic/119-web-tour` · Issue: `gh issue list --search "Epic 119 in:title"` · Model: DeepSeek V4.1 Flash · Budget: 60–120 min of autonomous work**

## Where you are
Starling (`.orchestrator/PRD.md`) is an open-source, open-weight-first harness. It turns one coding goal into a lane-safe task DAG, runs a flock of opencode agents in parallel git worktrees on this laptop and on other laptops ("perches"), audits each result, and merges everything through a queue, shown live in a murmuration dashboard.

**Waves 0, 1, C1 and 2 are merged** (tags `epic-NN-complete`). About 2,500 tests pass across every package, the CLI, server, web dashboard, skill, tools and evals. Epic 40 (integration captain) is landing the **real** composition (`starling run` driving real opencode agents) in parallel with you, so for now `apps/cli`, `packages/core`, `packages/llm`, `packages/runner` and `apps/web/src/data` are **off limits** (Wave 3b takes them after Epic 40 merges).

**Wave 3 is the big one: about 100 agents run at the same time on one laptop**, each in its own worktree and lane. That only works if everyone follows the rules below exactly.

**Read before you start:** `AGENTS.md`, `.orchestrator/ARCHITECTURE.md` (§6 contracts, §7 locked decisions), the `docs/epic-*.md` for every package you touch (their "Interfaces for future epics" sections), the handbacks in `.orchestrator/handbacks/` that mention your area, and **`.orchestrator/fix-requests-w2.md`**.

## Tech decisions already locked (build on these, don't relitigate)
ARCHITECTURE §7 **L1–L31** still hold (Bun 1.4.4, TS 5.9.3, zod 4, Biome 2.6.3; web tests run in their own process; Markdown formatter off; no local models; real LLM calls only via the `opencode` profile). Wave 3 adds:
- **L32 Lanes are absolute.** Write only inside your lane, plus your own `docs/epic-119-web-tour.md` and `.orchestrator/handbacks/119-web-tour.md`. Shared registration files you don't own (`apps/web/src/App.tsx` and `app/Layout.tsx`, `apps/cli/src/program.ts`, `apps/server/src/app.ts`, any package `index.ts` outside your lane) are **wired later by checkpoint C3**. Ship your work as a self-contained module with the manifest described in your prompt, and say in the handback exactly what C3 must add (file, line, code).
- **L33 Public APIs are additive only.** Never rename or remove an export, field, route, CLI flag or event other code uses. Deprecate instead. About 100 branches merge after yours.
- **L34 No new dependencies.** Don't touch any `package.json` dependency list, `bun.lock`, the root `package.json`, `tsconfig.base.json` or `biome.json`. Everything you need is already installed (React 19, lucide-react, zustand, @xyflow/react, Tailwind v4, Hono, commander, zod, bun:test, happy-dom, Playwright). If something is truly missing, write a CONTRACT REQUEST instead.
- **L35 Heavy commands go through the slot gate.** With 100 agents, everyone running the full suite at once would melt the laptop. While iterating, run **only your own tests** (`bun test <your dir>`; for web code `cd apps/web && bun test src/features/<x>`) and **only your own typecheck** (`bunx tsc --noEmit -p <your package or app>`). Run the full suite **once, at the end**, through the gate: `bash .orchestrator/bin/heavy.sh bun run test` and `bash .orchestrator/bin/heavy.sh bun run check` (also wrap `bun run build` and any Playwright run). The gate may print "waiting" for a few minutes. If your shell tool times out while it waits, just run it again.
- **L36 Bugs outside your lane are FIX REQUESTS, never edits.** QA epics record a confirmed bug as **`test.todo('BUG <area>: <one line>', () => { ... })`** with the real assertions inside, plus a FIX REQUEST. Never use `test.failing` and never commit a red test: about 100 fixes land in parallel, and a `test.failing` turns red the moment someone fixes the bug. **The one allowed cross-lane edit:** if your fix makes an existing `test.failing` probe in `tools/security/**` pass, change that probe's `test.failing(` to `test(` in the same PR (nothing else in that file) and say so in the handback.
- **L37 No real model calls and no real Starling runs in Wave 3a** unless your prompt says otherwise. Use the recorded runs in `fixtures/runs/*.jsonl`, `@starling/core/testing` fakes and the mock compose paths. No Ollama, no local models (L23).
- **L38 Tests live next to the code, and everything is deterministic.** No sleeps over 50 ms, no wall-clock assertions, no network beyond `127.0.0.1` on port `0`, and temp dirs under `os.tmpdir()` that clean up after themselves. Another 99 agents are hammering the CPU, so timing-sensitive tests will flake.
- **L39 Web feature manifest (new feature folders).** Your folder's `index.ts` exports your components plus one manifest, so C3 can wire about 15 new features with one line each:
  ```ts
  import type { ComponentType } from 'react';
  import type { SkyState } from '../../data/reducer';
  export interface FeatureProps { state: SkyState; onSelectTask?(key: string): void; onSelectRun?(runId: string): void; onClose?(): void }
  export const feature = {
    id: '<folder-name>', title: 'Human title', description: 'One line for the command palette',
    kind: 'view' /* centre view like Sky/DAG */ | 'panel' /* side or bottom panel */ | 'overlay' /* modal, palette, toasts, tour */ | 'page' /* full page at ?page=<id> */,
    icon: '<lucide-react icon name>', hotkey: '<your assigned key or undefined>',
    Component: YourRootComponent as ComponentType<FeatureProps>,
  } as const;
  ```
  Read state only through `FeatureProps` and the existing pure selectors in `apps/web/src/data/selectors.ts` (import, never edit). Build a `Playground.tsx` + `playground.html` (copy the pattern from `features/dag`) so the feature can be seen on its own with `fixtures/runs/*.jsonl` data. Use only the existing design tokens and components (`apps/web/src/components`, `index.css` tokens). Light **and** dark mode, keyboard reachable, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
  Hotkeys already taken: `1 2 b f ? Esc` and the arrows. Wave 3 assignments: report `r`, timeline `t`, lanes `l`, costs `c`, console `` ` ``, settings `,`, palette `mod+k`, compare `x`, export `e`, scrubber `.`, heatmap `h`, leaderboard `L`, stage `s`, topology `o`, health `!`. Everything else gets no hotkey.
- **SkyState facts you must design around** (`apps/web/src/data/reducer.ts`, read-only):
  `state.events` holds only the **active run's** events plus global `runId: '*'` flock events, capped at `EVENT_CAP` = 5,000, so every derivation needs a fallback from the `Run`/`TaskRun` snapshots in `state.runs` (`startedAt`, `finishedAt`, `status`, `attempts`, `usage`, `costUsd`, `nodeId`, `lastVerdict`). `state.verdicts` and `state.agentLog` are keyed by **task key only** (not run), so filter them by the active run's task keys. `state.metricsHistory` is not per run. `activeRunOf`, `sortedRuns`, `sortedNodes`, `displayTasks` come from `data/selectors.ts`.
- **Event contract drift.** Epic 40 is adding `'run.status'` to core's `StarlingEvent` union and `nodeName?` to `TaskRun`. Never write an exhaustive `never` switch over `StarlingEvent['type']`: use a `default:` branch, and `isRunStatusEvent` from `../../data/run-status` for run status. Read `nodeName` structurally and fall back to `state.nodes[nodeId]?.name ?? nodeId`.
- **Imports.** Runtime values from `@starling/core/browser` only (`PRICING`, `usageCostUsd`, `globsOverlap`, `matchesGlob`, schemas); `import type` from it for types. Shared helpers: `lib/format` (`formatDuration`, `formatUsd`, `formatTokens`, `percent`; note `cached` is a **subset** of `input` in `TokenUsage`, so a token total is `input + output`, not `totalTokens()`, which adds `cached` too), `lib/status` (`STATUS_COLORS`, `statusLabel`, `taskTone`), `components` (`Panel`, `Stat`, `Badge`, `EmptyState`, `Tabs`, `Tooltip`, `Kbd`), `usePrefersReducedMotion`/`useNow` from `../metrics`. Another feature's helpers only through its `index.ts`.
- **The shell binds your hotkey** (Epic 112's registry, wired at C3). Don't add a document-level `keydown` listener for it; handle keys only while focus is inside your component. Extra props beyond `FeatureProps` must be **optional** (so the `ComponentType<FeatureProps>` cast stays honest); list them under **C3 wiring**. Also export `FEATURE = '<folder>' as const` (the existing folder smoke-test convention).
- **Playground recipe:** `applyEvents(createInitialState(), demoEvents().slice(0, i))` (from `../../data/reducer` and `../../data/demo`) with an event-index range slider, so the feature can be seen mid-run and at the end. Copy `features/dag/{playground.html,playground-main.tsx}`. Put the pure derivation in `derive.ts` (tested without a DOM), and component tests use `ensureDom()` from `../../lib/test-dom` + `@testing-library/react`. Clear `localStorage` after each test that writes it.

## FIRST TASK: carryover
Open `.orchestrator/fix-requests-w2.md`. Implement every request that targets a file in your lane, or decline it with a one-line reason. List each one in your handback under **Carryover done**.


## Your lane (you may write ONLY here)
`apps/web/src/features/tour/**`
plus `docs/epic-119-web-tour.md` and `.orchestrator/handbacks/119-web-tour.md`. Read anything.

## Goal
A judge walks up to the laptop mid-demo. In under a minute a spotlight tour should explain the Sky, the flight plan, the flock, an agent's transcript, the landing strip and the cost meter, using the real UI in demo mode. It must never get stuck: a missing anchor, a resized window or a collapsed region degrades to a centred card.

## Deliverables
1. `tour/steps.ts`: `TOUR_STEPS: readonly TourStep[]` (7 steps), `TourStep = { id, title, body, anchor?: string /* CSS selector */, placement: 'top' | 'bottom' | 'left' | 'right' | 'center', action?: 'select-first-running-task' }`. Anchors use **existing** hooks only: `[data-region="sky"]`, `[role="tablist"][aria-label="Centre view"]` (Sky/DAG tabs), `[data-region="flock"]`, `[data-region="drawer"]`, `[data-region="queue"]`, `[data-region="metrics"]`, plus Epic 112's new `[data-shell="views-menu"]` as an optional anchor with a centred fallback. Copy is short, friendly and specific to Starling (lanes, audits, merge queue, local vs API cost).
2. `tour/geometry.ts`: `spotlightRect(el, padding, viewport)` and `placeCard(target, card, viewport, placement)` (pure; flips when it would overflow; clamps inside the viewport with a 12 px margin; `center` when there's no target).
3. The drawer step calls `onSelectTask(key)` with the first task whose status is `running|auditing|fixing`, else the first task (from `activeRunOf(state)`), so the drawer is open when the spotlight arrives. If there are no tasks, it falls back to a centred card.
4. `Tour` (kind `overlay`): a dimmed backdrop with an SVG mask cut-out around the anchor, a card with step x/7, Back / Next / Skip, and Finish on the last step. Keys while open: →/Enter next, ← back, Esc skip (calls `onClose`). Focus is trapped in the card, `role="dialog"` with `aria-live="polite"` step text. Re-measures on resize/scroll (`ResizeObserver` guarded) and when the anchor appears late. Reduced motion: no spotlight animation.
5. **Persistence:** `localStorage['starling.tour.v1'] = { seen: true, at }` on finish/skip (guarded). Export `shouldAutoStartTour(search: string, storage?): boolean` (true on `?tour=1`, or first visit in demo mode when `?demo=1`; false when seen). C3 uses it for the shell's `defaultOpen`. "Restart tour" is just opening the overlay again (palette/menu).
6. `index.ts` manifest: id `tour`, kind `overlay`, icon `Compass`, hotkey undefined. Export `TOUR_STEPS`, `shouldAutoStartTour`.
7. Playground: renders a mock of the shell's six `data-region` boxes plus the tablist so every step has a real anchor, a toggle that removes two anchors to show the fallback, and the fixture state for the drawer step.
8. Tests: ≥ 12 geometry/steps tests (placement flips, clamping, center fallback, anchors listed exist in the playground mock, `shouldAutoStartTour` table) and ≥ 10 component tests (next/back/skip/finish, keyboard, Esc calls `onClose`, focus trap, missing anchor → centred card, drawer step calls `onSelectTask` with a running task, storage written on finish).

## Explicitly out of scope
- Adding anchors or attributes to the shell or other features (ask Epic 112/C3 in the handback if one is missing). Auto-starting the tour from the shell (C3). Video/GIF recording.

## Definition of done (run literally, paste results in the handback)
1. `bun install` clean in your worktree (it must not change `bun.lock`).
2. `cd apps/web && bun test src/features/tour` → 0 fail, ≥ 22 new tests
3. `bunx tsc --noEmit -p apps/web` clean, `bunx biome check apps/web/src/features/tour` clean
4. A happy-dom test walks all 7 steps with the keyboard over the playground mock and ends with `starling.tour.v1` written
5. `bash .orchestrator/bin/heavy.sh bun run test` at the repo root → 0 fail (paste both halves' summary lines).
6. `bash .orchestrator/bin/heavy.sh bun run check` → clean.
7. `docs/epic-119-web-tour.md` (AGENTS.md §6 sections) and `.orchestrator/handbacks/119-web-tour.md` written. The handback has **Carryover done**, **C3 wiring** (exact code C3 must add, or "none") and **FIX REQUESTS** (or "none") sections. PR opened per AGENTS.md §6 with `Closes #<issue>`. Print the PR URL last.

## Git
Branch `epic/119-web-tour`. Conventional Commits scoped to your lane, committed small and often (at least 5 commits). `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main` before pushing. No merging, no tags. Never `git add -A` at the repo root without checking `git status` first: only your lane's files belong in the PR.
